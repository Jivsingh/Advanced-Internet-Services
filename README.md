# Advanced-Internet-Services
Java code written by me as part of the Advanced Internet Services course at Columbia

Audio-Unicast is developed as a baby monitor Java program implementing a unicast audio sender and receiver. The program records audio blocks, compresses them using mu-law encoding, sends them over the network using UDP and plays them back at the receiver continuously.
